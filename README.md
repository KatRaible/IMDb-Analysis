IMDB MOVIES/SHOWS REPORT
Task: Use the datasets available on IMDB to generate a report on Movie/TV show reviews. 

Data: IMDB has several datasets at this link. Select three or more of these to analyze. Read through the dataset details to understand what each dataset contains. Download and unzip the data files you selected.

Submission Requirements: You must include/demonstrate the following:
Jupyter notebook containing code, python visualizations, and interpretations of results
Successfully loading at least 3 datasets into Pandas for EDA
3 TSV files (title.akas.tsv.gz, title.basics.tsv.gz, title.crew.tsv.gz, title.episode.tsv.gz, etc.)
All three datasets should be used in some capacity in your report
EDA following standard practice to analyze data for report, including (but not limited to):
Descriptive Statistics
Covariance/Correlation
Data cleaning
Visualization containing two quantitative variables
Visualization containing one quantitative and one categorical variable
Visualization containing distribution information of quantitative variable(s)
Topic of report should be interesting and thought provoking, but the results don’t necessarily have to be surprising (i.e. don’t worry if your visualizations don’t reach any unexpected conclusions)
The report and visualizations must be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with both data analysis and the streaming industry
PowerBI dashboard including at least three different visualizations reporting on an aspect of the IMDB data
The report and visualizations (including PowerBI) must be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with both data analysis and the IMDB data

Optional enhancements:
Add a prediction model in your report
Use Jupyter’s nbconvert to export your Jupyter notebook into a PDF with presentation in mind. Here is an example of well-presented Jupyter notebooks: flipping.pdf

Final Submission:
Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) containing at least:
Four different questions that are explored and answered
At least two visualizations for each of the four questions
A summary for each question explaining what approach you took and what your conclusions were
PowerBI Dashboard (.pwib) containing at least three visualizations reporting on an aspect of the streaming industry
